<p>This mod is focused around magic. It is separated in three 'ages' that you have to progress through. As of yet there are "<i18n:custom:divination_module.totemic>", "<i18n:custom:divination_module.mirror>" and "<i18n:custom:divination_module.celestial>" ages. <modname> adds quite a lot of magic in your world and is very good in magical modpacks.</p>
<p>To begin the mod, you should find <i18n:block:divinationmod:mysterium_ore> and mine it. You would get a few <i18n:item:divinationmod:mysterium_cluster>. Grind them in a <i18n:item:minecraft:bowl> with a <i18n:item:minecraft:flint> in your 2x2 crafting inventory. What will happen next? Well, that part you should discover yourself.</p>
<p>One thing for sure, this mod is going to greatly change your survival, make it more interesting but dangerous.</p>
<p>Good part about the mod is that everything in the mod could be obtained even on public servers, making it good for single-and-multi-player.</p>
<p>Our team hopes that you will accept this mod and play it for your own pleasure!</p>
